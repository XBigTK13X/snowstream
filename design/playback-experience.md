# Terminology

Snowstream has (right now), two things

Stream Sources and Shelves

A stream source provides streamables. These are typically livestreams that may not be played from the beginning and play count doesn't matter.

Shelves contain references to files on a disk that can be played, seeked, etc.

The common use case is to navigate into a shelf or stream source, select one piece of media, consume it, then close the app.

A secondary nearly as common case is to queue up a selection of media and then play until the queue is depleted.

Continue watching describes a page of the app that shows all the shelved content that hasn't yet been watched.

A playlist is a collection of media, could be anything on a shelf, where a "Playlist:X" tag appears in the NFO.

A queue will be the term for handling things like shuffling a season or "continue watching" an entire show/season in order one after another without stopping.
